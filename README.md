# To-Do App

This is a simple web application that allows users to add and manage their to-do tasks. Users can add new tasks by providing a task name and a description of the task. The application displays two lists - "Pending Tasks" and "Completed Tasks" - where users can see the status of their tasks and mark them as done when they are completed.

## Usage
